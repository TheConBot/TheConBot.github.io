### Description
Twitch Sings is a karaoke game built specifically to be streamed on Twitch. With live singing, multiplayer modes, and features that let chat direct the show, the game lets you and your community make one-of-a-kind performances together. This project was made in collaboration with Twitch, Harmonix, and Free Range Games.

Twitch Sings was unfortunately shut down in 2021. However, there are [plenty of videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9pc4lhu02_iWMicVUFWjpw) that show off the experience of what it was like to be a viewer in the chat watching streamers play the game!

#### Programming (C#, Javascript):
* UI/UX Engineering (C#)
* Backend Development (Javascript)

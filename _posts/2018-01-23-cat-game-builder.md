CAT (Conditions, Actions, and Triggers) Game Builder is a fully extendable framework designed for use by professional teams yet easy enough for beginners to master. Using a similar workflow and design to built-in Unity components, CAT Game Builder seamlessly extends the Unity editor to become a complete game making tool. Its power, ease of use, and versatility make CAT an excellent choice for individuals and teams of all sizes.

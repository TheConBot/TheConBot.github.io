Outerworld Image is a surreal, meditative photography game. Walk around a neon planet, taking photos at your leisure that can be saved and shared, while listening to some calming music and not thinking about the end of the world. Made by 5 students in a semester. 

"You know, to remind you of the good times when you were inside a weird, pink game world, and not in this overwhelming collapsible reality."

Olympus is a 2 player arcade game where you and your opponent face off in a dodgeball match as one of four characters from Greek mythology. Choose your character, a stage, and the amount of balls to appear on the court and then battle for glory in a best of 5 match. Each character has a unique special ability which they gain once they enjoy a cold beer specially brewed by River Styx Brewing, who this game was made in collaboration with!

There is only one copy of this game in existence, which is installed in a cocktail cabinet located at [River Styx Breweing](https://www.google.com/maps/place/River+Styx+Brewing/@42.5818778,-71.8014058,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xbf6d3de40912945c?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjU65Sjqs_kAhWjMX0KHTDuBkQQ_BIwDHoECAsQCA). Take a trip with a friend to their tap room to try their amazing beer and the game. Make sure to bring your quarters; it's $0.50 per play!

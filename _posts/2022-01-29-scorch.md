### Description
"The sun is life for some. But not you. It seems that, despite the way it looks, the world is a harsh place. You just have to stay in the dark and make it to the only light that won't try and hurt you, then you'll be alright. But out of the corner of your eye, something... "other"... approaches. What is it trying to say?!"

Scorch is a 3D adventure puzzle game where you play as a cat who cannot survive being exposed to sunlight as you make your away across three different level to reach the goal. The game was made in 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2022!
